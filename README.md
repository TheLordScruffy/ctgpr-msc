# CTGP-R MSC

CTGP-R MSC (Mass Storage Class) is a custom launcher for CTGP-R that adds support for USB storage. It works by patching IOS to catch and redirect commands directed to the SD Card. This makes it possible to use CTGP on a Wii Mini, or a Wii/Wii U with a broken SD Card slot.

This project is based on [Saoirse](https://github.com/TheLordScruffy/saoirse).

## Installing

Make sure your USB device is formatted to FAT32, then follow the [guide on the ChadSoft website](https://chadsoft.co.uk/install-guide/) for regular CTGP-R, using a USB device in place of an SD Card. Download the latest release of CTGP-R MSC from here and then launch it using the Homebrew Channel. It can be installed to the Wii Menu as well just by using the regular CTGP-R channel installer. If you have already installed the regular CTGP-R channel, simply remove it and then add it again when launching through CTGP-R MSC.
